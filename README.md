# Simple-Pendulum
Simulations of non-linear simple pendulum


A non linear simple pendulum is simulated on the Matlab depicting the phase plane plot and time vs displacement plots. The non-linear
pendulum equation is solved using Matlab. Mass, length, damping and duration of pendulum can be changed in the code to illustrate the cases of undamped, critically damped, underdamped and overdamped motion.
